# Teach-a-class - Fault-tolerance and distributed systems

In this quick introductory presentation on fault-tolerance and distributed systems we introduce the definition of a distributed system and metrics for measuring their design. We then go on to discuss foundational concepts such as system and failure models as well as the problem of consensus (as a first introduction to distributed algorithms).
